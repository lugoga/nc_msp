## Current Conditions & Field Operations

:::{.callout-warning}
### 🌊 Coastal Weather & Seasonal Information for Field Operations

**Current Season (December 2025 - March 2026): Northeast Monsoon (Kaskazi)**

This period is the prime season for coastal field operations with favorable conditions for marine research and vessel deployment.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Wind Pattern** | Northeast winds (Kaskazi), 10-20 knots |
| **Sea State** | Calm to moderate seas (0.5-1.5m waves) |
| **Rainfall** | Minimal to moderate (short rains ending in December) |
| **Sea Temperature** | 24-26°C (warm and stable) |
| **Visibility** | Excellent visibility for surveys and observations |
| **Best Days** | Early mornings typically offer calmest conditions |

**Field Campaign Implications:**
- ✓ January 2026 field surveys scheduled during optimal conditions
- ✓ Excellent conditions for biodiversity validation work
- ✓ Safe for community engagement and stakeholder meetings
- ✓ Suitable for remote sensing data collection with minimal cloud cover

**Upcoming Weather Consideration:**
The transition to the Southeast Monsoon (Habagika) typically begins in April, bringing increased rainfall and potentially rougher seas. This aligns with our project timeline to complete major fieldwork before April.

### 📍 **January 2026 - Field Validation Campaign**

Comprehensive field surveys are being mobilized across both study sites:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Timeline** | January 15-31, 2026 |
| **Locations** | Mkoani District (Pemba Island) & Mkuranga District (Pwani Region) |
| **Lead Team** | Dr. Masumbuko Semba (NM-AIST) & Dr. Siajali Pamba (SOAF) |
| **Activities** | Biodiversity validation • Ecosystem classification verification • Ground-truth habitat mapping • Community engagement |
| **Stakeholders** | Local fishing communities • District authorities • Conservation partners |

**Expected Outputs:**

- ✓ Validated ecosystem type classifications
- ✓ Ground-truth biodiversity and habitat extent data
- ✓ Baseline monitoring indicators established
- ✓ Community knowledge integration documented

---

### 🤝 **February 28, 2026 - Stakeholder Validation Workshop**

A comprehensive stakeholder validation meeting will present interim findings and gather feedback:

**Agenda:**

1. Spatial ecosystem classification results
2. Habitat uniqueness and conservation priority mapping
3. Preliminary biodiversity assessment findings
4. Community perspectives and local knowledge integration
5. Policy recommendations framework

**Participants:**

- Government representatives (Mainland Tanzania & Zanzibar)
- District leadership (Mkoani & Mkuranga)
- Fishing associations and community representatives
- Conservation NGO partners
- Academic institutions and research team

**Venue:** To be confirmed (likely Dar es Salaam or Zanzibar)
