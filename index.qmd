## About MSP

This Marine Spatial Planning project develops comprehensive spatial plans for sustainable coastal and marine resource management in Mkoani (Pemba) and Mkuranga (Pwani Region), Tanzania. The initiative integrates scientific research, stakeholder engagement, and participatory planning to support evidence-based marine governance and blue economy development.

:::{.callout-important}
**Target Audience:** Marine resource managers, fisheries professionals, conservation practitioners, and policy makers seeking to improve coastal governance and sustainable use of marine resources in Tanzania and the broader Indian Ocean region.

### Current Conditions for Coastal Operations

**Mkoani-Pemba & Mkuranga Study Sites** | Updated: Today

| Metric | Current Status | Field Impact |
|--------|---|---|
| **Wind Pattern** | Northeast Monsoon (Kaskazi) | ✓ Optimal for operations |
| **Sea State** | Calm to Moderate (0.5-1.5m) | ✓ Safe for vessel deployment |
| **Air Temperature** | 26-28°C | ✓ Suitable for fieldwork |
| **Sea Temperature** | 24-26°C | ✓ Stable, excellent for surveys |
| **Rainfall Outlook** | Minimal to Light | ✓ Clear skies expected |
| **Visibility** | Excellent | ✓ Ideal for remote sensing |

**⚡ Key Takeaway:** Current conditions are **EXCELLENT** for biodiversity field surveys and stakeholder engagement activities scheduled for January 2026. Early mornings (06:00-10:00 local time) offer the calmest sea states.

**Seasonal Note:** The Northeast Monsoon season (Dec 2025 - Mar 2026) is the prime operational window. Conditions will transition to Southeast Monsoon (Habagika) in April, bringing increased rainfall and rougher seas.

## Implementation Approach

- **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in scientific data and international best practices for marine spatial planning
- **Participatory**: Inclusive engagement with fishing communities, government agencies, and conservation partners
- **Integrative**: Combines biological, geomorphological, socioeconomic, and economic analyses
- **Adaptive**: Built-in mechanisms for monitoring, evaluation, and plan refinement
- **Scalable**: Approaches applicable to other coastal regions in Tanzania and the Indian Ocean
