- (This copies the code automatically)

**Back in Supabase:**
- In the SQL editor, click in the text area
- Paste the code (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V)
- You should see something like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE msp_registrations (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,

)
```

2. Log in with your email
3. Open your "MSP Registration Database" project
4. Click "Table Editor" → "msp_registrations"
5. See all registrations in real-time!

### Export Data
In Supabase Table Editor:
- Click the menu (⋮) next to table name
- Choose "Export" → "Download as CSV"
- Get all registrations in a spreadsheet

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I forgot my Supabase password**
- Go to supabase.com → "Forgot password"

**Q: Table doesn't appear in Supabase**
- Check that you ran the SQL code in SQL Editor
- Make sure you clicked the blue "Run" button

**Q: Connection test fails**
- Double-check Project URL is spelled correctly
- Double-check API key is complete (no missing characters)
- Make sure you created the table first

**Q: Registrations not appearing in Supabase**
- Test the registration form at `/events`
- Check browser console (F12 → Console) for errors
- Make sure table is named exactly "msp_registrations"
