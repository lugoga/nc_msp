We begin by loading specialized R packages designed for spatial analysis: terra for raster operations, sf for vector geometries, and tidyterra to bridge spatial data with tidyverse workflows. These packages provide efficient tools for reading, manipulating, and visualizing large spatial datasets.\nWe source ESA WorldCover 10m resolution land cover data for our study areas. The Mkoani district data covers the Pemba region, while Mkuranga district is defined by a specific geographic extent. Converting these rasters to factors (categorical data) is essential—it tells R that the numeric values represent discrete land cover categories rather than continuous measurements, which enables proper labeling and visualization.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(tidyterra)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(webr)\n\n\nWe’ll work with ESA WorldCover 10m resolution land cover data for two districts in Tanzania.

    "text": "Creating a Standardized Color Scheme\nConsistent color representation across all visualizations is crucial for effective communication and reproducibility in scientific analyses. We create a reference dataframe (worldcover_df) that maps each ESA WorldCover land cover category to a standardized hex color code based on official ESA specifications.

    "text": "Visualizing Land Cover Maps\nRaster maps provide an intuitive visual representation of land cover distribution across space. By mapping pixel values to colors using our standardized scheme, we can immediately identify dominant land cover types and their spatial arrangement. The maps below use a minimal theme with subtle axes to keep focus on the spatial patterns themselves rather than chart elements.\nThe composition pie charts complement the maps by quantifying the areal proportion of each land cover type. Rather than showing all categories, we exclude water bodies (which often dominate coastal areas due to ocean coverage) to better visualize terrestrial land cover proportions. The start angle adjustment ensures labels are positioned for readability.\n\nMkoani District\nThe Mkoani district, located on Pemba Island, displays a landscape heavily influenced by its island geography and historical land use patterns. Figure 1 reveals extensive forest cover interspersed with agricultural areas and coastal features, reflecting a balance between conservation and subsistence livelihoods common in coastal communities.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_spatraster(data = pemba_lulc) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 4)) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Land Cover Map of Mkoani District (2021).

Forest dominates, but the presence of significant grassland and cropland areas indicates active land use management and potential agricultural expansion in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Land Cover Composition of Mkoani District. The donut chart quantifies the areal proportion of each land cover category (excluding water bodies). Forest dominates at approximately 60-70% of terrestrial area, with significant proportions of cropland and grassland indicating active agricultural land use. The inner ring shows the absolute pixel counts while the outer ring displays proportions, revealing both the extent and relative importance of each category for landscape management planning.\n\n\n\n\n\nMkuranga District\nMkuranga district, located on mainland Tanzania, exhibits land cover patterns shaped by different historical and socioeconomic drivers than Mkoani. Figure 3 substantial forest coverage with more fragmented patterns of agriculture and grasslands scattered throughout. The landscape mosaic suggests a history of selective land clearing and agricultural development within forested terrain.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_spatraster(data = mkuranga_lulc) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 4)) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Land Cover Map of Mkuranga District (2021). This map shows the mainland Pwani region’s land cover at 10m resolution, revealing a complex mosaic of forest (dark green), grasslands (yellow), and agricultural areas (magenta) typical of coastal Tanzania. The fragmented pattern of land cover suggests a history of selective clearing within forested terrain, with agriculture and settlement distributed throughout rather than consolidated into larger blocks. Source: ESA WorldCover 10m.\n\n\n\nComparing the composition pie charts between Mkoani and Mkuranga reveals that while both regions are forest-dominated, the proportion of agricultural land differs, with Mkuranga (Figure 4) showing a somewhat higher proportion of grassland. These subtle differences in composition may reflect different population densities, market access, and management priorities across the two regions.\n\n\nCode\nmkuranga_lulc |&gt; \n    terra::freq() |&gt; \n    as.data.frame() |&gt; \n    rename(label = value) |&gt;\n    left_join(worldcover_df, by = c(\"label\")) |&gt;\n    filter(!label == 'Permanent water bodies') |&gt;\n    webr::PieDonut(aes(label, count = count, fill = color), labelposition = 1, r0 = .6, r1 = 1, ,start=3*pi/8) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Land Cover Composition of Mkuranga District. Compared to Mkoani, Mkuranga shows higher proportions of grassland and a slightly lower forest percentage, suggesting different land use pressures or natural vegetation patterns on the mainland. The composition analysis demonstrates that while forest remains the dominant land cover in both districts, the relative proportions of agricultural and grassland areas differ—information crucial for tailoring district-specific conservation and livelihood strategies within the marine spatial planning framework."

However, the spatial arrangement and composition of other land cover types differ between regions, reflecting distinct management histories and development trajectories. The presence of significant agricultural lands alongside forests suggests these areas support mixed subsistence and commercial activities.\nThese foundational observations establish the baseline for deeper spatial pattern analysis. Understanding composition alone is insufficient—the configuration of these land covers (their fragmentation, connectivity, and spatial arrangement) determines ecosystem resilience and management effectiveness. The next phase of analysis will quantify these spatial patterns using advanced techniques to identify areas of unique land cover organization."

    "section": "Spatial Methods",
    "text": "Spatial Methods\nSpatial approaches incorporate neighborhood relationships—the idea that ecosystem changes in one location are influenced by surrounding areas.\n\nFocal Correlation: Local Pattern Similarity\nThe focalPairs() function calculates correlation between moving windows of two rasters, revealing how similar local ecosystem patterns are:\n\n\nCode\n# Compare local ecosystem patterns between 2020 and 2023\n# 5x5 window (50m × 50m with 10m resolution data)\nmkoani_cor = terra::focalPairs(c(mkoani_2023, mkoani_2020), \n                               w = 5,\n                               fun = \"pearson\", \n                               na.rm = TRUE)\n\nplot_div(mkoani_cor, main = \"Local Ecosystem Pattern Similarity (r)\")\n\n\nInterpretation: - Values near +1 (green): Local ecosystem patterns are highly similar—changes are gradual - Values near 0 (yellow): No relationship between 2020 and 2023 local patterns—potential abrupt shifts - Values near -1 (magenta): Inverse relationship—significant pattern transformation\n\n\nSurface Roughness Change\nSurface roughness measures spatial heterogeneity—how much ecosystem health varies within local neighborhoods:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(geodiv)\n\nwindow = matrix(1, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)\n\n# Calculate surface roughness for both years\nmkoani_2020_sa = geodiv::focal_metrics(mkoani_2020, \n                                       window = window,\n                                       metric = \"sa\", \n                                       progress = FALSE)\n\nmkoani_2023_sa = geodiv::focal_metrics(mkoani_2023, \n                                       window = window,\n                                       metric = \"sa\", \n                                       progress = FALSE)\n\n# Difference in roughness\nmkoani_sa_diff = mkoani_2023_sa$sa - mkoani_2020_sa$sa\n\nplot_div(mkoani_sa_diff, \n         main = \"Change in Ecosystem Heterogeneity\\n(Positive = More Variable Health)\")\n\n\nInterpretation: - Positive values (green): Ecosystem health is becoming more variable—potential patchiness increasing - Negative values (magenta): Ecosystem becoming more homogeneous—potentially homogenizing pressures - Management implication: High variability in small areas may require targeted interventions\n\n\nTexture Homogeneity\nGLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix) texture homogeneity characterizes spatial structure:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(GLCMTextures)\n\n# Calculate texture homogeneity (smoothness of transitions)\nmkoani_2020_hom = GLCMTextures::glcmTexture(mkoani_2020, \n                                            window = 5, \n                                            metrics = \"homogeneity\")\n\nmkoani_2023_hom = GLCMTextures::glcmTexture(mkoani_2023, \n                                            window = 5, \n                                            metrics = \"homogeneity\")\n\nmkoani_hom_diff = mkoani_2023_hom - mkoani_2020_hom\n\nplot_div(mkoani_hom_diff, \n         main = \"Change in Ecosystem Texture Smoothness\\n(Positive = Smoother Transitions)\")\n\n\n\n\nRao’s Quadratic Entropy\nRao’s Q measures diversity while accounting for dissimilarity between ecosystem states:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(rasterdiv)\n\n# Convert to integer scale (multiply by 100)\nmkoani_2020_int = as.int(mkoani_2020 * 100)\nmkoani_2023_int = as.int(mkoani_2023 * 100)\n\n# Calculate Rao's Q (computational intensity: ~5-10 minutes)\nmkoani_2020_rao = rasterdiv::paRao(mkoani_2020_int, window = 5, progBar = FALSE)\nmkoani_2023_rao = rasterdiv::paRao(mkoani_2023_int, window = 5, progBar = FALSE)\n\n# Extract difference\nmkoani_rao_diff = mkoani_2023_rao[[1]][[1]] - mkoani_2020_rao[[1]][[1]]\n\nplot_div(mkoani_rao_diff, \n         main = \"Change in Ecosystem Diversity\\n(Positive = More Diverse Health Patterns)\")\n\n\nInterpretation: Higher Rao’s Q values indicate greater ecosystem diversity within local areas—potentially reflecting multiple habitat types or species communities.\n\n\nSpatial Autocorrelation of Changes\nSpatial autocorrelation shows whether ecosystem changes are clustered or random:\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate Moran's I for the change raster\nmkoani_diff_autocor = terra::autocor(mkoani_diff, method = \"moran\", global = FALSE)\n\n# Compare original difference and its spatial autocorrelation\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\nplot_div(mkoani_diff, main = \"Ecosystem Health Change\")\nplot_div(mkoani_diff_autocor, main = \"Spatial Autocorrelation of Changes\")\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))\n\n\nInterpretation: - High positive Moran’s I (green): Changes cluster spatially—improvements cluster with improvements, degradation with degradation (suggests shared drivers) - Near-zero Moran’s I (yellow): Random change patterns—no spatial clustering - Negative Moran’s I (magenta): Dispersed patterns—improvements surrounded by degradation\n\n\nStructural Similarity Index (SSIM)\nSSIM combines luminance, contrast, and structure comparisons mimicking human perception of similarity:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(SSIMmap)\n\nmkoani_ssim = ssim_raster(mkoani_2020, mkoani_2023, global = FALSE, w = 5)\n\nplot_div(mkoani_ssim[[1]], \n         main = \"Local Structural Similarity\\n(1 = Identical, 0 = Completely Different)\")\n\n# Also get global SSIM\nssim_raster(mkoani_2020, mkoani_2023, global = TRUE)\n\n\nInterpretation: - SSIM = 0.85: Overall ecosystem structure is very similar between years (2023 shows minor changes to 2020 baseline) - SSIM = 0.50: Moderate structural change (noticeable ecosystem transformation) - SSIM &lt; 0.30: Substantial structural change (major ecosystem shifts)"

Connectivity and Restoration Priorities\nMkoani’s higher fragmentation suggests that restoration efforts should focus on: - Creating corridors between isolated mangrove patches - Restoring seagrass connectivity between reef and coastal zones - Establishing stepping-stone habitats for fish migration - Identifying and protecting critical linking areas\nMkuranga’s lower fragmentation allows for different strategies: - Focus on patch quality and habitat health - Maintain existing connectivity - Identify nodes for intensive protection (marine parks) - Plan for sustainable extraction with connectivity in mind\n\n\n2. Ecosystem Service Provision\nLandscape fragmentation directly affects ecosystem services:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService\nImpact of Fragmentation\n\n\n\n\nFish recruitment\nFragmented habitats = reduced larval connectivity\n\n\nCarbon sequestration\nDispersed mangroves = less carbon stock aggregation\n\n\nShoreline protection\nIsolated patches = gaps in storm surge buffering\n\n\nBiodiversity support\nFragmented habitat = isolation effects on species\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Climate Resilience\nLandscape complexity and connectivity determine resilience to climate change:\n\nMore fragmented (Mkoani): Greater vulnerability to localized disturbances; lower climate resilience\nMore connected (Mkuranga): Better ability to maintain function if some patches degrade\n\nThis suggests different vulnerability assessments and adaptation strategies for each district.\n\n\n4. Management Unit Design\nThe spatial pattern analysis helps define appropriate management units:\n\nMkoani: May need smaller, intensively managed zones given fragmentation\nMkuranga: Can support larger management units leveraging natural connectivity"

    "text": "Conclusion: Spatial Patterns as a Foundation for Planning\nUnderstanding and comparing spatial patterns in marine ecosystem data is not merely an academic exercise—it’s essential groundwork for effective marine spatial planning. By quantifying how ecosystems are arranged, we move from subjective observations to objective, measurable metrics that support evidence-based management decisions.\nFor Mkoani and Mkuranga, these analyses reveal that while both districts contain critical marine ecosystems, their spatial organization demands different management approaches. The tools and methods presented here will support the marine spatial planning team in designing conservation and sustainable use strategies tailored to each district’s unique ecological structure.\n\nReferences:\n\nHesselbarth, M.

We create a reference dataframe (worldcover_df) that maps each ESA WorldCover land cover category to a standardized hex color code based on official ESA specifications.

The land cover comparison between 2020 and 2021 reveals the baseline conditions and any changes occurring within the first year of the planning initiative. Understanding what happens on land is essential to marine planning because terrestrial land use directly influences coastal water quality, sediment loading, nutrient runoff, and ultimately the health of nearshore marine ecosystems.

    "text": "Understanding Land Cover Transitions\nBeyond static snapshots, understanding how land cover types change from one category to another provides critical insights into ecosystem dynamics and land use trajectories. A transition matrix—also called a cross-tabulation or contingency table—reveals exactly which land cover types are converting to which alternatives. For example, are forests converting directly to cropland (indicating clearing for agriculture), or is forest first transitioning to grassland/shrubland (indicating intermediate disturbance)? These transition pathways reflect different management practices and have distinct implications for ecosystem recovery and conservation strategy.\nThe transition matrix quantifies all land cover changes occurring between 2020 and 2021 in Mkoani district. Rows represent the 2020 baseline condition and columns represent the 2021 outcome. Diagonal values (where row and column match) indicate persistence—areas where the land cover remained unchanged. Off-diagonal values indicate transitions—areas where land cover shifted from one type to another. This granular perspective reveals not just net changes in composition, but the specific pathways through which landscape transformation is occurring.\nUnderstanding these transitions is essential for marine spatial planning because different conversion pathways have different implications for coastal water quality. Forest-to-cropland transitions typically increase nutrient and sediment runoff. Forest-to-built-up transitions concentrate impacts in specific locations affecting local hydrology. Grassland-to-cropland transitions may increase soil erosion. By identifying the dominant transition pathways, managers can target interventions precisely where they will have the greatest benefit for coastal ecosystem health.\n\n\nCode\nchange = diffeR::crosstabm(pemba_lc[[1]],pemba_lc[[2]], percent = FALSE)\nlabels_lulc = worldcover_df$label[c(-7,-11)]\nrownames(change) = labels_lulc\ncolnames(change) = labels_lulc\nchange_ha = (change*100)/4063.74  # convert to hectares\n\n\n\n\nCode\nchange_ha |&gt; \n    round(1) |&gt; \n    as_tibble(rownames = \"lc_2020\") |&gt; \n    gt::gt() |&gt;\n    gt::tab_header(\n        title = \"Land Cover Transition Matrix\",\n        subtitle = \"Area (hectares) of each land cover type in 2020 converting to 2021 categories\"\n    ) |&gt;\n    gt::opt_stylize(style = 1) |&gt;\n    gt::tab_style(\n        style = gt::cell_fill(color = \"#e8f4f8\"),\n        locations = gt::cells_body()\n    ) |&gt;\n    gt::fmt_number(columns = -lc_2020, decimals = 1)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Land Cover Transition Matrix for Mkoani District (2020-2021).

Summing across a row gives the total area of that land cover type in 2020; summing down a column gives the total area of that type in 2021.

The “cove” (composition + configuration) signature captures both what habitats are present AND how they’re arranged:\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate composition-configuration signatures\nmkoani_cove = lsp_signature(habitat_mkoani, \n                            type = \"cove\", \n                            classes = 1:7)\n\nmkuranga_cove = lsp_signature(habitat_mkuranga, \n                              type = \"cove\", \n                              classes = 1:7)\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Pattern Comparison\nCompare the overall spatial patterns between regions using Jensen-Shannon divergence (a dissimilarity measure: 0 = identical, 1 = completely different):\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate Jensen-Shannon divergence between regions\nglobal_dissimilarity = dist_one_one(\n  mkoani_cove$signature[[1]], \n  mkuranga_cove$signature[[1]], \n  method = \"jensen-shannon\"\n)\n\nglobal_dissimilarity\n\n\nInterpretation Examples: - Dissimilarity = 0.05: Very similar habitat patterns (comparable management approaches may work in both) - Dissimilarity = 0.25: Notably different patterns (management must be adapted to local conditions) - Dissimilarity = 0.50+: Substantially different ecosystems (distinct management strategies needed)"
