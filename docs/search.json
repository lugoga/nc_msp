The land cover comparison between 2020 and 2021 reveals baseline conditions and the trajectory of landscape change within the first year of the marine spatial planning initiative. Understanding terrestrial land use is fundamental to marine planning because landscape patterns directly influence coastal ecosystem health. Forest cover protects watersheds, reduces erosion, and maintains water quality. Agricultural expansion increases nutrient runoff and sedimentation. Mangrove forests provide critical fish nursery habitat. Urban expansion concentrates impacts on local hydrology and water quality.

    "section": "Understanding Land Cover Transitions",
    "text": "Understanding Land Cover Transitions\nBeyond static snapshots, understanding how land cover types change from one category to another provides critical insights into ecosystem dynamics and land use trajectories. A transition matrix—also called a cross-tabulation or contingency table—reveals exactly which land cover types are converting to which alternatives. For example, are forests converting directly to cropland (indicating clearing for agriculture), or is forest first transitioning to grassland/shrubland (indicating intermediate disturbance)? These transition pathways reflect different management practices and have distinct implications for ecosystem recovery and conservation strategy.\nThe transition matrix quantifies all land cover changes occurring between 2020 and 2021 in Mkuranga District. Rows represent the 2020 baseline condition and columns represent the 2021 outcome. Diagonal values (where row and column match) indicate persistence—areas where the land cover remained unchanged. Off-diagonal values indicate transitions—areas where land cover shifted from one type to another. This granular perspective reveals not just net changes in composition, but the specific pathways through which landscape transformation is occurring in Mkuranga.\nUnderstanding these transitions is essential for marine spatial planning in Mkuranga because different conversion pathways have different implications for coastal water quality and fishery productivity. Forest-to-cropland transitions typically increase nutrient and sediment runoff that degrade nearshore water quality. Mangrove loss directly reduces fish nursery habitat and coastal protection. Grassland-to-cropland transitions may increase soil erosion and sedimentation into coastal zones. Forest-to-built-up transitions concentrate impacts affecting local hydrology. By identifying the dominant transition pathways in Mkuranga, managers can target land-based interventions precisely where they will have the greatest benefit for coastal and fishery ecosystem health.\n\n\nCode\nchange = diffeR::crosstabm(mkuranga_lc[[1]],mkuranga_lc[[2]], percent = FALSE)\nlabels_lulc = worldcover_df$label[c(-7,-11)]\nrownames(change) = labels_lulc\ncolnames(change) = labels_lulc\nchange_ha = (change*100)/4063.74  # convert to hectares\n\n\n\n\nCode\nchange_ha |&gt; \n    round(1) |&gt; \n    as_tibble(rownames = \"lc_2020\") |&gt; \n    gt::gt() |&gt;\n    gt::tab_header(\n        title = \"Land Cover Transition Matrix\",\n        subtitle = \"Area (hectares) of each land cover type in 2020 converting to 2021 categories in Mkuranga District\"\n    ) |&gt;\n    gt::opt_stylize(style = 1) |&gt;\n    gt::tab_style(\n        style = gt::cell_fill(color = \"#e8f4f8\"),\n        locations = gt::cells_body()\n    ) |&gt;\n    gt::fmt_number(columns = -lc_2020, decimals = 1)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Land Cover Transition Matrix for Mkuranga District (2020-2021).

For instance, the “Tree cover” row shows how forest pixels were distributed across different categories in 2021. The largest value in that row indicates the most common fate of forests—whether persistence, conversion to agriculture, or other uses. Summing across a row gives the total area of that land cover type in 2020; summing down a column gives the total area of that type in 2021. Values on the diagonal represent stability—areas where land cover persisted unchanged and therefore represent the landscape’s resilience to conversion.\n\n\nCode\nchange_ha |&gt; \n    round(1) |&gt; \n    as_tibble() |&gt; \n    mutate('x2020' = labels_lulc, .before = `Tree cover`) |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(-x2020, names_to = 'x2021', values_to = 'area_ha') |&gt; \n    gt::gt() |&gt;\n    gt::opt_stylize(style = 1) |&gt;\n    gt::fmt_number(columns = -area_ha, decimals = 1) |&gt; \n    gt::cols_label(\n      x2020 = \"2020\",\n      x2021 = \"2021\",\n      area_ha = \"Area (hectares)\"\n    ) |&gt; \n    gt::tab_spanner(columns = 1:2, label = \"Land Cover\") |&gt;\n    gt::fmt_number(columns = area_ha, decimals = 1)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Detailed Land Cover Transitions for Mkuranga District (2020-2021). Each row shows a specific transition from a 2020 land cover type to a 2021 outcome, with the corresponding area in hectares. This format facilitates filtering to identify specific conversion pathways of interest—for example, finding all areas converted from Forest to Cropland, or from Mangrove to other land cover types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand Cover\n\nArea (hectares)\n\n\n2020\n2021\n\n\n\n\nTree cover\nTree cover\n1,554.6\n\n\nTree cover\nShrubland\n213.9\n\n\nTree cover\nGrassland\n2.7\n\n\nTree cover\nCropland\n801.9\n\n\nTree cover\nBuilt-up\n102.1\n\n\nTree cover\nBare/sparse vegetation\n14.8\n\n\nTree cover\nWater bodies\n34.3\n\n\nTree cover\nHerbaceous wetland\n228.5\n\n\nTree cover\nMangroves\n164.5\n\n\nShrubland\nTree cover\n4.0\n\n\nShrubland\nShrubland\n319.2\n\n\nShrubland\nGrassland\n0.1\n\n\nShrubland\nCropland\n35.5\n\n\nShrubland\nBuilt-up\n0.2\n\n\nShrubland\nBare/sparse vegetation\n0.1\n\n\nShrubland\nWater bodies\n7.8\n\n\nShrubland\nHerbaceous wetland\n58.9\n\n\nShrubland\nMangroves\n0.2\n\n\nGrassland\nTree cover\n18.6\n\n\nGrassland\nShrubland\n0.3\n\n\nGrassland\nGrassland\n57.9\n\n\nGrassland\nCropland\n1,151.2\n\n\nGrassland\nBuilt-up\n80.4\n\n\nGrassland\nBare/sparse vegetation\n1.1\n\n\nGrassland\nWater bodies\n8.2\n\n\nGrassland\nHerbaceous wetland\n75.0\n\n\nGrassland\nMangroves\n5.6\n\n\nCropland\nTree cover\n326.9\n\n\nCropland\nShrubland\n27.3\n\n\nCropland\nGrassland\n243.4\n\n\nCropland\nCropland\n99,861.7\n\n\nCropland\nBuilt-up\n794.9\n\n\nCropland\nBare/sparse vegetation\n52.8\n\n\nCropland\nWater bodies\n1,398.4\n\n\nCropland\nHerbaceous wetland\n7,692.3\n\n\nCropland\nMangroves\n10.0\n\n\nBuilt-up\nTree cover\n285.7\n\n\nBuilt-up\nShrubland\n0.0\n\n\nBuilt-up\nGrassland\n41.0\n\n\nBuilt-up\nCropland\n1,462.1\n\n\nBuilt-up\nBuilt-up\n1,734.6\n\n\nBuilt-up\nBare/sparse vegetation\n33.3\n\n\nBuilt-up\nWater bodies\n22.3\n\n\nBuilt-up\nHerbaceous wetland\n100.5\n\n\nBuilt-up\nMangroves\n421.1\n\n\nBare/sparse vegetation\nTree cover\n56.7\n\n\nBare/sparse vegetation\nShrubland\n0.0\n\n\nBare/sparse vegetation\nGrassland\n0.5\n\n\nBare/sparse vegetation\nCropland\n400.5\n\n\nBare/sparse vegetation\nBuilt-up\n228.5\n\n\nBare/sparse vegetation\nBare/sparse vegetation\n14,796.6\n\n\nBare/sparse vegetation\nWater bodies\n65.8\n\n\nBare/sparse vegetation\nHerbaceous wetland\n676.6\n\n\nBare/sparse vegetation\nMangroves\n257.4\n\n\nWater bodies\nTree cover\n4.2\n\n\nWater bodies\nShrubland\n16.6\n\n\nWater bodies\nGrassland\n19.0\n\n\nWater bodies\nCropland\n11,031.4\n\n\nWater bodies\nBuilt-up\n26.6\n\n\nWater bodies\nBare/sparse vegetation\n22.7\n\n\nWater bodies\nWater bodies\n6,471.5\n\n\nWater bodies\nHerbaceous wetland\n17,094.2\n\n\nWater bodies\nMangroves\n0.4\n\n\nHerbaceous wetland\nTree cover\n1.3\n\n\nHerbaceous wetland\nShrubland\n107.3\n\n\nHerbaceous wetland\nGrassland\n11.2\n\n\nHerbaceous wetland\nCropland\n8,862.6\n\n\nHerbaceous wetland\nBuilt-up\n76.4\n\n\nHerbaceous wetland\nBare/sparse vegetation\n27.8\n\n\nHerbaceous wetland\nWater bodies\n1,759.5\n\n\nHerbaceous wetland\nHerbaceous wetland\n104,319.0\n\n\nHerbaceous wetland\nMangroves\n0.7\n\n\nMangroves\nTree cover\n200.4\n\n\nMangroves\nShrubland\n0.0\n\n\nMangroves\nGrassland\n0.0\n\n\nMangroves\nCropland\n29.1\n\n\nMangroves\nBuilt-up\n203.4\n\n\nMangroves\nBare/sparse vegetation\n23.4\n\n\nMangroves\nWater bodies\n0.3\n\n\nMangroves\nHerbaceous wetland\n1.6\n\n\nMangroves\nMangroves\n160,242.6"

We create a reference dataframe (worldcover_df) that maps each ESA WorldCover land cover category to a standardized hex color code based on official ESA specifications.

    "text": "Visualizing Land Cover Maps\nRaster maps provide an intuitive visual representation of land cover distribution across space. By mapping pixel values to colors using our standardized scheme, we can immediately identify dominant land cover types and their spatial arrangement. The maps below use a minimal theme with subtle axes to keep focus on the spatial patterns themselves rather than chart elements.\nThe composition pie charts complement the maps by quantifying the areal proportion of each land cover type. Rather than showing all categories, we exclude water bodies (which often dominate coastal areas due to ocean coverage) to better visualize terrestrial land cover proportions. The start angle adjustment ensures labels are positioned for readability.\n\nMkoani District\nThe Mkoani district, located on Pemba Island, displays a landscape heavily influenced by its island geography and historical land use patterns. Figure 1 reveals extensive forest cover interspersed with agricultural areas and coastal features, reflecting a balance between conservation and subsistence livelihoods common in coastal communities.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_spatraster(data = pemba_lulc) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 4)) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Land Cover Map of Mkoani District (2021). The map displays ESA WorldCover 10m resolution classification showing the distribution of forest (dark green), agricultural areas (magenta), grasslands (yellow), and other land cover types across Pemba Island.

Forest dominates, but the presence of significant grassland and cropland areas indicates active land use management and potential agricultural expansion in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Land Cover Composition of Mkoani District. The donut chart quantifies the areal proportion of each land cover category (excluding water bodies). Forest dominates at approximately 60-70% of terrestrial area, with significant proportions of cropland and grassland indicating active agricultural land use. The inner ring shows the absolute pixel counts while the outer ring displays proportions, revealing both the extent and relative importance of each category for landscape management planning.\n\n\n\n\n\nMkuranga District\nMkuranga district, located on mainland Tanzania, exhibits land cover patterns shaped by different historical and socioeconomic drivers than Mkoani. Figure 3 substantial forest coverage with more fragmented patterns of agriculture and grasslands scattered throughout. The landscape mosaic suggests a history of selective land clearing and agricultural development within forested terrain.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_spatraster(data = mkuranga_lulc) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 4)) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Land Cover Map of Mkuranga District (2021). This map shows the mainland Pwani region’s land cover at 10m resolution, revealing a complex mosaic of forest (dark green), grasslands (yellow), and agricultural areas (magenta) typical of coastal Tanzania. The fragmented pattern of land cover suggests a history of selective clearing within forested terrain, with agriculture and settlement distributed throughout rather than consolidated into larger blocks. Source: ESA WorldCover 10m.\n\n\n\nComparing the composition pie charts between Mkoani and Mkuranga reveals that while both regions are forest-dominated, the proportion of agricultural land differs, with Mkuranga (Figure 4) showing a somewhat higher proportion of grassland. These subtle differences in composition may reflect different population densities, market access, and management priorities across the two regions.\n\n\nCode\nmkuranga_lulc |&gt; \n    terra::freq() |&gt; \n    as.data.frame() |&gt; \n    rename(label = value) |&gt;\n    left_join(worldcover_df, by = c(\"label\")) |&gt;\n    filter(!label == 'Permanent water bodies') |&gt;\n    webr::PieDonut(aes(label, count = count, fill = color), labelposition = 1, r0 = .6, r1 = 1, ,start=3*pi/8) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Land Cover Composition of Mkuranga District. Compared to Mkoani, Mkuranga shows higher proportions of grassland and a slightly lower forest percentage, suggesting different land use pressures or natural vegetation patterns on the mainland. The composition analysis demonstrates that while forest remains the dominant land cover in both districts, the relative proportions of agricultural and grassland areas differ—information crucial for tailoring district-specific conservation and livelihood strategies within the marine spatial planning framework."

However, the spatial arrangement and composition of other land cover types differ between regions, reflecting distinct management histories and development trajectories. The presence of significant agricultural lands alongside forests suggests these areas support mixed subsistence and commercial activities.\nThese foundational observations establish the baseline for deeper spatial pattern analysis. Understanding composition alone is insufficient—the configuration of these land covers (their fragmentation, connectivity, and spatial arrangement) determines ecosystem resilience and management effectiveness. The next phase of analysis will quantify these spatial patterns using advanced techniques to identify areas of unique land cover organization."

These signatures enable us to compare regions not just by what land covers they contain, but by how those covers are spatially organized.\nFuture analyses will employ spatial signature matching to identify areas with similar land cover patterns, detect changes in spatial organization between time periods, and pinpoint regions with unique or anomalous spatial configurations. These advanced methods reveal landscape-level changes that simple composition analysis cannot capture, enabling more targeted conservation and land management strategies tailored to regional characteristics."

Converting these rasters to factors (categorical data) is essential—it tells R that the numeric values represent discrete land cover categories rather than continuous measurements, which enables proper labeling and visualization.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(tidyterra)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nrequire(tidyplots)\n# library(webr)\nrequire(patchwork)\nrequire(gt)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlulc_2020 &lt;- greenSD::get_esa_wc(\n    bbox = mkoani_bbox, \n    year = 2021,\n    # place = 'Dar es Salaam, Tanzania', \n    datatype = \"landcover\"\n    )\n\nlulc_2020 |&gt; \n    terra::writeRaster(\n        filename = 'data/mkoani_lulc_2021.tif',\n         overwrite=TRUE, \n         datatype='INT1U'\n    )\n\n\nLoad the raster data for Mkoani District:\n\n\nCode\npemba_lc20 = terra::rast('mkoani_lulc_2020.tif') |&gt; \n    as.factor()\n\npemba_lc21 = terra::rast('mkoani_lulc_2021.tif') |&gt; \n    as.factor()"

We create a reference dataframe (worldcover_df) that maps each ESA WorldCover land cover category to a standardized hex color code based on official ESA specifications.

The land cover comparison between 2020 and 2021 reveals baseline conditions and the trajectory of landscape change within the first year of the marine spatial planning initiative. Understanding terrestrial land use is fundamental to marine planning because landscape patterns directly influence coastal ecosystem health. Forest cover protects watersheds, reduces erosion, and maintains water quality. Agricultural expansion increases nutrient runoff and sedimentation. Mangrove forests provide critical fish nursery habitat. Urban expansion concentrates impacts on local hydrology and water quality. Tracking these changes year-to-year allows us to assess whether land use intensification, landscape degradation, or conservation success is occurring—information essential for coastal management decisions in Mkoani.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_spatraster(data = pemba_lc) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 3)) +\n  # scale_fill_identity(name = \"Land Cover Type\", guide = \"legend\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)+\n  facet_wrap(~lyr, ncol=2, labeller = labeller(lyr = c(lc_2020 = \"2020: Baseline Land Cover\", lc_2021 = \"2021: Current Land Cover\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Temporal Land Cover Comparison for Mkoani District (2020-2021).

    "section": "Understanding Land Cover Transitions",
    "text": "Understanding Land Cover Transitions\nBeyond static snapshots, understanding how land cover types change from one category to another provides critical insights into ecosystem dynamics and land use trajectories. A transition matrix—also called a cross-tabulation or contingency table—reveals exactly which land cover types are converting to which alternatives. For example, are forests converting directly to cropland (indicating clearing for agriculture), or is forest first transitioning to grassland/shrubland (indicating intermediate disturbance)? These transition pathways reflect different management practices and have distinct implications for ecosystem recovery and conservation strategy.\nThe transition matrix quantifies all land cover changes occurring between 2020 and 2021 in Mkoani district. Rows represent the 2020 baseline condition and columns represent the 2021 outcome. Diagonal values (where row and column match) indicate persistence—areas where the land cover remained unchanged. Off-diagonal values indicate transitions—areas where land cover shifted from one type to another. This granular perspective reveals not just net changes in composition, but the specific pathways through which landscape transformation is occurring.\nUnderstanding these transitions is essential for marine spatial planning because different conversion pathways have different implications for coastal water quality. Forest-to-cropland transitions typically increase nutrient and sediment runoff. Forest-to-built-up transitions concentrate impacts in specific locations affecting local hydrology. Grassland-to-cropland transitions may increase soil erosion. By identifying the dominant transition pathways, managers can target interventions precisely where they will have the greatest benefit for coastal ecosystem health.\n\n\nCode\nchange = diffeR::crosstabm(pemba_lc[[1]],pemba_lc[[2]], percent = FALSE)\nlabels_lulc = worldcover_df$label[c(-7,-11)]\nrownames(change) = labels_lulc\ncolnames(change) = labels_lulc\nchange_ha = (change*100)/4063.74  # convert to hectares\n\n\n\n\nCode\nchange_ha |&gt; \n    round(1) |&gt; \n    as_tibble(rownames = \"lc_2020\") |&gt; \n    gt::gt() |&gt;\n    # gt::tab_header(\n    #     title = \"Land Cover Transition Matrix\",\n    #     subtitle = \"Area (hectares) of each land cover type in 2020 converting to 2021 categories in Mkoani District\"\n    # ) |&gt;\n    gt::opt_stylize(style = 1) |&gt;\n    gt::tab_style(\n        style = gt::cell_fill(color = \"#e8f4f8\"),\n        locations = gt::cells_body()\n    ) |&gt;\n    gt::fmt_number(columns = -lc_2020, decimals = 1)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Land Cover Transition Matrix for Mkoani District (2020-2021).

Diagonal values show persistence (no change); off-diagonal values show transitions between categories. Large values in off-diagonal cells indicate active land conversion.

The Tree cover→Herbaceous wetland cell suggests forest areas becoming more waterlogged or managed for wetland agriculture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlc_2020\nTree cover\nShrubland\nGrassland\nCropland\nBuilt-up\nBare/sparse vegetation\nWater bodies\nHerbaceous wetland\nMangroves\n\n\n\n\nTree cover\n75.3\n179.2\n1.9\n427.2\n1.5\n50.5\n17.5\n254.7\n15.4\n\n\nShrubland\n0.5\n1,042.2\n0.0\n10.6\n0.0\n0.1\n0.0\n80.0\n2.2\n\n\nGrassland\n0.0\n0.5\n54.8\n77.9\n1.4\n0.2\n0.0\n1.7\n2.5\n\n\nCropland\n10.2\n23.8\n279.6\n8,194.5\n8.6\n7.3\n347.4\n1,030.8\n7.3\n\n\nBuilt-up\n18.7\n0.0\n31.3\n87.3\n185.3\n24.0\n2.2\n9.9\n260.6\n\n\nBare/sparse vegetation\n9.3\n0.5\n13.7\n157.2\n50.6\n11,206.4\n24.9\n1,027.9\n371.4\n\n\nWater bodies\n0.7\n0.9\n3.5\n680.8\n0.3\n7.3\n559.7\n302.8\n1.8\n\n\nHerbaceous wetland\n7.3\n450.0\n277.5\n4,545.5\n0.5\n62.9\n164.8\n57,254.8\n24.0\n\n\nMangroves\n26.8\n0.2\n0.8\n47.3\n97.5\n80.0\n9.1\n69.6\n91,272.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the transition matrix: Read each row to understand what happened to that 2020 land cover type. For instance, the “Tree cover” row shows how forest pixels were distributed across different categories in 2021. The largest value in that row indicates the most common fate of forests. Summing across a row gives the total area of that land cover type in 2020; summing down a column gives the total area of that type in 2021. Values on the diagonal represent stability—areas where land cover persisted unchanged and therefore represent the landscape’s resilience to conversion.\n\n\nCode\nchange_ha |&gt; \n    round(1) |&gt; \n    as_tibble() |&gt; \n    mutate('x2020' = labels_lulc, .before = `Tree cover`) |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(-x2020, names_to = 'x2021', values_to = 'area_ha') |&gt; \n    gt::gt() |&gt;\n    gt::opt_stylize(style = 1) |&gt;\n    gt::fmt_number(columns = -area_ha, decimals = 1) |&gt; \n    gt::cols_label(\n      x2020 = \"2020\",\n      x2021 = \"2021\",\n      area_ha = \"Area (hectares)\"\n    ) |&gt; \n    gt::tab_spanner(columns = 1:2, label = \"Land Cover\") |&gt;\n    gt::fmt_number(columns = area_ha, decimals = 1)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Long-Format Land Cover Transition Matrix for Mkoani District (2020-2021).
